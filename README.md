# myEach.js

Create a function called myEach.

It should accept an array as the first argument, and a function as the second argument.

This should work very similarly to how we pass a block to a method in Ruby.  In Ruby we yield each element of a collection to that block (an anonymous chunk of code) and in Javascript we call a function with each element of the array passed as an argument.

Your function should return the array itself (although in ECMAscript 6 forEach return undefined).
